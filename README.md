# AI-Powered-Call-Transcript-Analysis-App

This project is a hands-on AI application built using Snowflake, Streamlit, and Python to analyze and summarize customer support call transcripts. It showcases how to use Snowflakeâ€™s Cortex LLM functions for natural language processing (NLP) tasks on unstructured data.

## Features

- Summarize Call Transcripts using Snowflake Cortex `complete()` function.
-  Experiment with LLMs like Mistral 7B and LLaMA 3.2 by simply changing one line of code.
-  Streamlit UI for real-time input and summarization.
-  AWS S3 Integration to load raw CSV data into Snowflake tables.
-  Structured JSON Output for programmatic use: product name, defect, and summary.

##  Architecture Overview

- Data Source: AWS S3 bucket (CSV format call transcripts)
- Storage & Processing: Snowflake DB, schema, Snowpark
- LLM Inference: Cortex `complete()` function using Mistral/LLaMA models
- Frontend: Streamlit for user interaction and visualization

## Technologies Used

- Snowflake (Snowflake Notebooks, Snowpark, Cortex LLM)
- Python (pandas, Streamlit, snowflake-ml-python)
-Streamlit (app interface)
-LLMs: Mistral 7B, LLaMA 3.2 (via Snowflake Cortex)
-  AWS S3 (external stage for transcript CSVs)
